				i am ! ! ! Heavpoot#5118<br>
				if you don't know what lc is check out <a href=https://mondecitronne.com>mondecitronne</a><br/>

				<hr><span style=color:f80>5 lc:</span> website(?)<br>
				i will make a TOTALLY REAL website with TOTALLY REAL CONTENT for you. you will be responsible for hosting quite possibly. no guarantees of fitness for purpose or effort spent doing so, like everything here.<br><br>
				<hr><span style=color:f80>3 lc:</span> definitely not art<br>
				i will poorly draw any non-nsfw thing. mostly. i won't do it properly or very well, most likely. still, you can* purchase it.
